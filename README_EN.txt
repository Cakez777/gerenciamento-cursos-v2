This project is a fullstack application developed to manage courses, students, and enrollments, while also providing reporting features. The main idea was to build a simple yet functional platform that centralizes all this information in an organized and user-friendly way. For this purpose, I used Laravel for the backend and React.js for the frontend, both connected through a REST API.

The backend was built with Laravel and is responsible for all business logic, authentication, and database integration. To make the local setup easier, I used XAMPP, which provides Apache and MySQL already integrated. This allowed me to run the database in a straightforward way and keep the application working without issues. The backend exposes endpoints for creating, listing, editing, and deleting students, courses, and enrollments, as well as generating reports with key insights such as revenue and most accessed courses.

On the frontend side, I implemented the interface with React.js, focusing on simplicity and usability. The home page centralizes the system options and redirects the user to specific sections, such as registrations and reports. All communication with the backend happens through API requests, ensuring smooth integration between both layers.

To run the project locally, you need to have XAMPP installed and running, with Apache and MySQL enabled. After cloning the repository, go into the backend folder, install the dependencies with Composer, configure the Laravel .env file, run the migrations, and start the server with php artisan serve. For the frontend, enter its folder, run npm install, and then npm start. The React server will be available at http://localhost:3000.

With this setup, the application works fully: the backend manages the data securely and consistently, while the frontend provides the user interface for interaction. This project was designed as a practical study to strengthen my knowledge in Laravel, React, and system integration, while also showcasing how tools like XAMPP can speed up local development.
